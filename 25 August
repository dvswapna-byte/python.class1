CONCATINATION:-  Joining multiple strings

--> What is interpolation?
        Replacing placeholders with actual values is interpolation.
                ex: naming sticker placeholders will be given but for each student will be different

--> f string
        allows you to embed variables directly inside a string using {}

Operators
variables allows to assign data, retrieve data and manupilate data (if required)

    --> In pyhthon, an operator is a special symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed on one or more operands (values or variables).
        Operators are used to perform various operations such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more.
    --> In Lua, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables).
    --> Types of operators in python:
        1. Arithmetic Operators  +,-,*, / % //(floor dividion, not in decimal value, rounding off)
            ** exponentation.
        2. Comparison Operators:- used to compare values return a boolean type(either true or false)
                ==, !=, >,<, >=, <=,
        3. Logical Operators:- used to combine multiple conditions
                and, or, not
                returns when both condition are true, returns when atleast 1 condition is true, negates boolean value true to fasle - false ti true
        4. Assignment Operators
        5. Bitwise Operators
        6. Membership Operators
        7. Identity Operators
        8. Combined operator:- for concise coding
                                combination of arthematic and assigned operators
