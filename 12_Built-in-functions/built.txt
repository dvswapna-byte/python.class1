-> Built in Function 

        -> Functions which are already pre built into python 

        -> No need to define them 

        -> print() -> displays output 
        -> id () -> display object identity address 
        -> input() -> take user input 
        -> len() -> length of elements 
        -> max() -> largest element 
        -> etc 

    -> User Defined Functions 

        -> Functions which we create using def keyword, for custom requirements 

    -> Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)

        -> Lambda functions are One Line Functions 

        -> Especially for Single Line Expressions

        -> We use "lambda" keyword to work with lambda functions

        -> The result of lambda functions will be automatically returned 

        -> Mainly used for tasks, when passing a function as an argument

        -> Syntax 

            lambda arguments: expression

            NOTE : arguments can be multiple, but one line expression

    -> Higher Order Functions (Functional Style Of Writing Code)

        -> Functions taking another function as an argument.

    -> map, filter and reduce ==> Higher Order Functions

    -> map()

        -> Applies a function to each item in a iterable 

        -> Just like for loop 

        -> Think of map() as "Do this to every element in iterable"

        -> Syntax

            map(function, iterable)

    -> filter()

        -> Filters the items of an iterable based on condition

        -> Just like using a for loop with condition

        -> Syntax

            filter(function, iterable) => the function must return True or False
    

    -> reduce()

        -> Reduces an iterable to a single value, by applying the functions cumulatively (again & again) 

        -> Syntax

            reduce(function, iterable)
        
        -> NOTE : reduce was updated inside a module called functools, so to use reduce(), we need to import 


    -> Higher Order Functions 

        -> map() : For loop 
        -> filter() : For loop with condition
        -> reduce() : combine all to single value
