# STRINGS:-
    Strings are one of the most important and widely used data type. In python, string is sequence of charecters
    enclosed in " " or ' '.
    We can use triple codes but not recommended.

--> Indexing in python
        Python allows you to access each charecter in a string using an index number.
        Index starts from 0
        Index goes both in positive and negative direction.
--> We have predefined functions in Python
        len()-> returns number of items
 --------space is also a charecter in python---------

--> Slicing in Python
        Slicing means cutting a sub-string from the original string using index
        To access range of charecters in a string
