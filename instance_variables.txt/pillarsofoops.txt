    -> 4 Pillars Of OOP 

        -> Inheritance 

        -> Encapsulation

        -> Abstraction

        -> Polymorphism

    -> Inheritance 

        -> Inheritance is a core OOP concept where a new class, 
        called a subclass or child class, acquires the properties(vars) and methods 
        of an existing class, called a superclass or parent class.

        -> Main purpose of Inheritance is Code Reusability
        
        -> Syntax 

            class Parent:
                pass 

            class Child(Parent):
                pass 
        
        -> With Inheritance

            -> Code Reusability

            -> No Code Duplication 

            -> Project Size is less 

            -> Code Reliability improved 

            -> Code Maintainability improved

    -> Types Of Inheritance 

        -> Single Level Inheritance

            -> One Parent -> One Child 

        -> Multi Level Inheritance 

            -> Parent -> Child -> GrandChild 

        -> Multiple Inheritance 

            -> One Child -> Multiple Parents 

        -> Hierarchial Inheritance

            -> One Parent -> Multiple Child 

        -> Hybrid Inheritance

            -> Combination or two or more types
