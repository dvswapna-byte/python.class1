    -> Classes & Objects 

    -> syntax

        class ClassName:
            pass 

        object_name = ClassName()

    -> Classes will be called automatically unlike functions 

        -> class call is not mandatory 

    -> Methods 

        -> Methods are like functions which are associated with objects 

            -> Like a function / methods is also a block of code which does task 

        -> Methods are defined inside the class 

        ->                     Function                            Method

        How to call            function_name(args)                 object.method_name(args)

        Belongs To             Independent                         Object 

        Defined using          def function_name                   def method_name(inside class)

    -> self 

        -> self refers to the current object 
        -> python automatically passes self when you call a method using object 
        -> that's why your methods must accept self as first parameter 

        -> NOTE : self is like this in other programming language (java)

    -> __init__ 

        -> __init__ is a special method in python 

        -> In other programming languages we have constructors 

        -> In python constructor is a special method i.e __init__()

        -> __init__ runs automatically, when a object is created 

        -> __init__ is used to initialize values to an object 

        -> syntax

            class ClassName:
                def __init__(self,parameters):
                    # assign the values  

        -> __init__ Implicitly returns None and we cannot change it
