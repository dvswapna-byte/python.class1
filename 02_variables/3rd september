Scenario:- Basic Student Informaton

Information about Student
        ID
        Name
        Age
        Score

-> Use variable and different data types to store this data and use these operators to
    manipulate and compare it.
    STUDENT ACADEMIC AND ATTENDANCE DETAILS.

    1. Declare variables
        student id
        student name
        student age
        quiz score
        assignment score
        exam score
        student attendance
    2. Use arthematic operators to calculate
        total score
        average score
    3.Use relational operator to calculate
        if the student is passing based on the average score of 75
    4. Use increment operator to update
        attendance + or -
    5. Use logical operator to determine award eligibility
            if the student qualifies for an award requires high attendance
            i.e 90 and above or a passing grade
    6. Display result
        student information section
            ID, Name, age
        Academic performance section
            individual score, total, average
        Status section
            passing section and award eligibility

TYPE CONVERSION
        The above are used to convert from one data type to another data type
        TYPE CONVERSION:- Implicit/ Automatic
            Python will automatically do the conversion when it is safe and there is 
                no loss of data
        widening:- Converting smaller data type to larger
    # Type conversion
        a = 10
        b = 3.5
        c = a + b
        print(type(c))
        print(c)

TYPE CASTING
        Explicit convertion done by the developers manually by using built in function
        NARROWING:- converting large data type to smaller.
            int() - convers to integer
            float() - converts to float
            str() - converts to string
