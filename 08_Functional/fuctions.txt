#Function
A Function is block of code which performs some tasks

WHY FUNCTIONS
    -> Functions can break down and help you break complex problems into 
            simpler and smaller managable sub tasks
    -> You can call a function multiple times which will help you avoid code
            repetetion, eventually helps in codes reusability.
==> SYNTAX
    def function_name():
        statements

==> FUNCTIONS WITH PARAMETERS
    -> Using parameters with functios we can pass dynamic inputs for doing tasks
        def function_name(1, 2,...):
        statements

        3. Key word arguement based
        4. Arbitary Positional (*arge)
