=============

    -> Modules 

        -> A module is a python file (.py) that contains Python Definitions
            (variables, functions, classes etc) and Statements

        -> It allows you to reuse code, by importing the module, 
            instead of rewriting again and again


    -> Types Of Modules

        -> Built in modules

            -> Provided as part of python standard Library

        -> User Defined Modules

            -> Created by your self, based on custom requirements

        -> External Modules 

            -> Provided by 3rd party vendors, you need pip tool 

            -> pip : python package manager 

            -> pip install <package> (win)

            -> pip3 install <package> (mac)

            -> Downloaded from https://pypi.org/

    
    -> Syntax 

        import module (import whole module)

        from module import functionality (import specific functionality from module) (recommended)

=============

    -> functions : block of code for REUSABILITY

    -> modules : a file of code for REUSABILITY

    -> package : a folder of code for REUSABILITY

    -> Package 

        -> A folder with multiple modules (python files) 

        -> Use it with folder name 

        -> NOTE: We need to create a special file in order to make a folder as package

            -> __init__.py (empty content / start up configs)
        

    -> File Management With Python 

        -> File Operations

            -> CRUD 

                -> CREATE
                -> READ
                -> UPDATE 
                -> DELETE 

        -> Earlier all the above activities we did in non-persistent storage (RAM)

            -> non-persistent storage/data - Temporary 

        -> Now i need the programs to save the data (HDD/SSD)

            -> persistent storage/data - Permanent  

    -> A file can be controlled using open() function with modes 

        -> read - r
        -> write - w
        -> append - a 

8th Oct 2025
=============

    -> File Operations Continued 

    -> To Read we can use read(), readline(), readlines()

    -> To Write i.e we can also create / update using "w" mode 

        -> write mode will overwrite 

    -> To Append i.e ame as write but keeps previous data then write new data using "a" mode
