#Function
A Function is block of code which performs some tasks

WHY FUNCTIONS
    -> Functions can break down and help you break complex problems into 
            simpler and smaller managable sub tasks
    -> You can call a function multiple times which will help you avoid code
            repetetion, eventually helps in codes reusability.
