VARIABLES:-
        -> Holds data, names for memory locations
                Persistant data, non persistant data
                    Permanant and Temporary data
        -> Variables allows you to
                . assign the data
                . if required manupilate data
                . Retrive data

Syntax
    -> variable_name = value; = is called Assignment operator
      ex: student_age=25

      NOTE: IN PYTHON, THE TYPE OF VARIABLE CAN CHANGE DURING EXECUTION.

      NOTE: A FUNCTION DOES A TASK AND IS REPRESENED BY ()
      type() - what is the data type of specific variable.
      id() - gives the memory adress or location of variable.



mutable data is the data that can change or modified
        lists, dictionaries, sets etc 
immutable data that cannot be changed( no modifications can be done)
        numbers, strings, tuples etc

Any variable data can be output using PRINT function

START: starting value by default is 0
STOP: ending value excluded
STEP: increment by default is 1
TO DO THE STEP REVERSE USE -1

--> BRANCHING STATEMENTS[jump STATEMENTS]
                used to control the flow of iteration inside the loops
        . Break: exists the loop entirely
        . Continue: skips the current iteration and continue the loop
        . Pass : Does nothing generally used as placeholders

============

-> Looping through lists
->Using operator on elemens of lists
-> Conditionals
-> Duplicates are also allowed in lists
-> List operations/ Methods
        dir(list)
-> List charecteristics
        -> Ordered : List preserve data
        -> Mutable : Changable append(), remove()
        -> Duplicates are allowed
        -> Can hold different data types [int,str,float,etc]

17 September
=============
--> Tuple: SHOULD BE USED IN READ ONLY DATA. [CONSTANT,FIXED,STATIC]
