DATA Types
===========

    -> Data types are categories that will define, what kind of data a variable can Holds

    -> Numeric types
                -- numbers with or without decimal ponts
                    -- Integers: WHOLE NUMBERS 0,1,0-1,199 etc
                    -- Float: decimal numbers 3.14,2.45 etc
                    -- Complex: complex numbers like in maths
                                math: a + ib where i is imaginary
                                python: a + bj where j is imaginary

                -- Text Types
                    -- String: A sequence of charecters declared in ' ' or " "
                    PYTHON DOESNOT SUPPORT SINGLE CHARECTER DATA TYPE
                

                -- BOOLEAN TYPE
                    -- Returns True or False

                -- Sequence Types
                        -- String is a sequence type
                        -- List: Multiple values tom be stored as a sequence, represented in [ ]. Mutable
                        -- Tuples: Multiple values to be stored as a sequence, represented in ( ). Immutable
                        -- Range: 

                -- Set Types
                        -- set: Multiple values to be stored as a sequence, represented in { }. Mutable {unique}
                        -- Frozen set:  Multiple values to be stored as a sequence, represented in { }. Immutable {unique}

                -- Dictionary[mapping] Type
                        --  Multiple values to be stored as a sequence of key and values pairs, represented in { }

                -- None Type
                        -- absence of values, represents nothing

        ALL THE ABOVE ARE PREDEFINED DATA TYPES, WE CAN CREATE OUR CUSTOM DATA TYPES BASED ON REQUIREMENTS.
        STRINGS, SEQUENCE TYPES
