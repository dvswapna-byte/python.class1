=============

    -> Exception Handling 

        -> Exception : It's an Error, which occurs during the program execution 

        -> By default when python encounters an Error, it abruptly STOPS the Program 

        -> To change the above behavior, and handle the Exceptions by yourself we need following 

            -> try : used to keep the code that will cause errors 

            -> except : used to keep the code that should run, when error occurs 

            -> else : used to keep the code that should run, if no Exceptions are raised in try block 

            -> finally : used to keep the code, which should definitely run, even if there is an Exception or not 
                         closing connections etc

=============

    -> User Defined Exceptions 

        -> Syntax 

            class UserDefinedException(Exception):
                pass


    -> OOP 

        -> Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the "object" 
        a software entity that encapsulates data and function/method. 
        An OOP computer program consists of objects that interact with one another.

        -> OOP is way of writing programs that models real world entities (object)

            -> Student, Pen, Bike etc 

        -> Earlier 

            -> Writing Long List Of Instructions 

        -> Now 

            -> Think in terms of real world entities (object)

                -> Object - Data (Attributes / Variables)

                -> Object - Behavior (Methods / Functions)

        -> OOP Style Of Coding 

            -> Writing Code that follows Object Oriented Design

                -> Focus is in Objects & Object Relationship, not just functions

                -> You don't think about steps, you think about "who does what"

        ->  Four Pillars of OOP

            -> Inheritance 

                -> Reusability of Code From Parent Classes 

            -> Encapsulation

                -> Binding Data & Methods Together

            -> Abstraction 

                -> Hiding Complexity 

            -> Polymorphism

                -> Extensibility (One Entity -> Multiple Forms)
    
    ->                      Functional Style     vs      Object Oriented Style 

    -> Focus                Step by step actions            Real World Objects 

    -> Data & Function      Separate                        Combined Inside Class 

    -> Code Organization    One Big Script                  Multiple Reuseable Classes 

    -> Reusability          Harder                          Easier via Inheritance 

    -> Maintenance          Complex as code grows           Cleaner as 


    -> Functional Style Code 

        def student_attend_session(name):
            print(f"{name} attended session")

    -> Object Oriented Style Code

        class Student:
            def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name 

            def attend_session(self):
                print(f"{self.name} attended session")

        -> OOPS version binds data and methods together     

    -> Why OOP / Advantages of OOP

        -> Makes Code Modular (Easy To understand)

        -> Lot Of Reusability 

        -> Supports Scalability (Easy To Build A Growing System )

        -> Mirrors Real World Structure

    -> Object 

        -> In terms of real world everything is an object

        -> Object has two entities

            -> An Object has something like Characteristics / properties (DATA) (car)

                -> car has a brand 
                -> car has a color
                -> car has price  


            -> An Object does something like behavior (METHOD) (car)

                -> car does drive forward
                -> car does drive backward
                -> car does horn
                -> car does blinkers 

            -> So, How to create an object ?

                -> We need Class 


    -> Class 

        -> A class is blueprint that defines Characteristics / properties (DATA) 
        and behaviors (METHOD) of an object 

    -> Object

        -> An Object is actual / real instance of a class

=============

    -> Classes & Objects 

    -> syntax

        class ClassName:
            pass 

        object_name = ClassName()

    -> Classes will be called automatically unlike functions 

        -> class call is not mandatory 

    -> Methods 

        -> Methods are like functions which are associated with objects 

            -> Like a function / methods is also a block of code which does task 

        -> Methods are defined inside the class 

        ->                     Function                            Method

        How to call            function_name(args)                 object.method_name(args)

        Belongs To             Independent                         Object 

        Defined using          def function_name                   def method_name(inside class)

    -> self 

        -> self refers to the current object 
        -> python automatically passes self when you call a method using object 
        -> that's why your methods must accept self as first parameter 

        -> NOTE : self is like this in other programming language (java)

    -> __init__ 

        -> __init__ is a special method in python 

        -> In other programming languages we have constructors 

        -> In python constructor is a special method i.e __init__()

        -> __init__ runs automatically, when a object is created 

        -> __init__ is used to initialize values to an object 

        -> syntax

            class ClassName:
                def __init__(self,parameters):
                    # assign the values  

        -> __init__ Implicitly returns None and we cannot change it
